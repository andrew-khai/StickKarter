### <a name="intro"></a> Introduction
Stickkarter is a fullstack clone of Kickstarter, a crowd-funding site. Features include user authentication, projects, rewards, and backings. A signed in user is able to create a project of their own, edit their projects, create rewards for their projects, edit those rewards, and also back other projects. Logged in users are able to see all the projects that they have created, and or backed. All users are able to see single project pages for each project.
